# M12 - Investigate a set

## Rule

An investigation is a dated analysis of a set's population against its charter's vision, scope and growth policy.\
It produces a partition, the place of each member in it, and the gaps; the charter is unchanged by it.

1. **Read the charter and every member.** The vision and scope say what the set is for; the growth policy says how it grows and what members are balanced on.
2. **Propose a partition derived from the members - or a coverage join (`M_A x M_B`) where the set covers another charted set.** For an internal partition, cut by the members' triggers, subjects, or moments so that every member lands in it, and in exactly one place. Where Set B's charter declares relational coverage over Set A, form the cross-set coverage matrix `M_A x M_B`: every populated member of Set A must map to at least one primary covering member of Set B (totality), each member of Set B must state its unique marginal coverage (minimal covering set), and unallocated or malformed members discovered in Set A are recorded as upstream Set A hygiene findings. More than one partition or join is usually defensible; state why this one was chosen.
3. **Let the scope set the extent, not the population.** A cell no member fills is kept and named as a gap; removing it to match the population erases the gap it exposes.
4. **Test each gap.** Search the corpus for a member, or guidance elsewhere, that already fills it, and name the searches run. A gap that survives is real; a candidate that would fill it is named where one exists.
5. **Show a gap or argue there is none.** A partition that names at least one checked absence has shown it can detect one; one that names none must say why the population is complete against it.
6. **Check the balance** against the growth policy: a crowded cell beside empty ones is a finding.
7. **Record it in the project's own record**, dated, citing the charter (or both charters in a cross-set `M_A x M_B` join) it measured against. Where the investigation probes runtime execution across a trust boundary, attach the three-part two-key verification receipt (raw platform audit-log export, deterministic cross-consistency script verdict, and post-hoc challenge-response probe). The charter does not link to it.
8. **Carry each gap to the backlog** ([`AR5`](../artifacts/AR5-backlog.md)) as a row with a revival trigger; the board ([`AR3`](../artifacts/AR3-board.md)) weighs them for the director.
9. **If the vision, scope or growth policy is itself shown wrong,** propose a re-aim under [`M11`](M11-change-a-charter.md); a finding about members - overlap, crowding, a candidate - is acted on by [`M13`](M13-change-a-set.md).

## Rationale

A charter describes the ideal and cannot see its own population, so completeness is found by measuring, not by declaring.\
Cutting the set is a judgement that can be made more than one way, so it is held in a dated analysis a later investigation may replace, rather than in the charter where it would freeze the set.\
The obligations in steps 2 to 5 are what make a partition able to find anything: a well-formed partition that cannot detect a gap is decoration.

## When to apply

- Before deciding what a set should admit next.
- When a set reads as complete to the people who use it, which is when a missing kind is least visible.
- After a change to a charter's vision, scope or growth policy, to measure the population against it again.
